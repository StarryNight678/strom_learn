Storm 1.0.0说性能提升了16倍,延迟减少了60%

自动反压机制

[Storm 1.0.0 released](http://storm.apache.org/2016/04/12/storm100-released.html)

- Improved Performance

One of the main highlights in this release is a dramatice performance improvement over previous versions. Apache Storm 1.0 is **up to 16 times faster than previous versions, with latency reduced up to 60%**. Obviously topology performance varies widely by use case and external service dependencies, but for most use cases users can expect a 3x performance boost over earlier versions.

- Automatic Backpressure

In previous Storm versions, the only way to throttle the input to a topology was to enable ACKing and set topology.max.spout.pending. For use cases that don't require at-least-once processing guarantees, this requirement imposed a significant performance penalty.

Storm 1.0 includes a new automatic backpressure mechanism based on configurable high/low watermarks expressed as a percentage of a task's buffer size. If the high water mark is reached, Storm will slow down the topology's spouts and stop throttling when the low water mark is reached.

Storm's backpressure mechanism is implemented independently of the Spout API, so all existing Spouts are supported.

[讲解UI](http://www.malinga.me/reading-and-understanding-the-storm-ui-storm-ui-explained/)

Latency – The latency there is intentional since the bolt is buffering tuples and batching writes to a database. The stat measures the time between a tuple being received and being marked as completed (acked), and that bolt acks the tuple only after it has been written to the db.

Complete latency – The average time a Tuple “tree” takes to be completely processed by the Topology. A value of 0 is expected if no acking is done

Execute latency – The average time a Tuple spends in the execute method. The execute method may complete without sending an Ack for the tuple.


Process latency – The average time it takes to Ack a Tuple after it is first received. Bolts that join, aggregate or batch may not Ack a tuple until a number of other Tuples have been received.
