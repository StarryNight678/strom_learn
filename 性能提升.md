# 性能提升

性能如何提升,提升了哪些方面?


Storm 1.0.0说性能提升了16倍,延迟减少了60%
自动反压机制

[Storm 1.0.0 released](http://storm.apache.org/2016/04/12/storm100-released.html)

- Improved Performance

One of the main highlights in this release is a dramatice performance improvement over previous versions. Apache Storm 1.0 is **up to 16 times faster than previous versions, with latency reduced up to 60%**. Obviously topology performance varies widely by use case and external service dependencies, but for most use cases users can expect a 3x performance boost over earlier versions.

- Automatic Backpressure

In previous Storm versions, the only way to throttle the input to a topology was to enable ACKing and set topology.max.spout.pending. For use cases that don't require at-least-once processing guarantees, this requirement imposed a significant performance penalty.

Storm 1.0 includes a new automatic backpressure mechanism based on configurable high/low watermarks expressed as a percentage of a task's buffer size. If the high water mark is reached, Storm will slow down the topology's spouts and stop throttling when the low water mark is reached.

Storm's backpressure mechanism is implemented independently of the Spout API, so all existing Spouts are supported.
